  ]
}}
```

## Your Task:
Generate up to {max_queries} effective search queries that will retrieve the most relevant information for the given section and its subsections.

## Query Generation Process:

### For Initial Runs (no previous_queries or reflection_feedback):
1. Analyze the section name and all subsection descriptions thoroughly
2. Identify the core concepts, key terms, and relationships that need to be researched
3. Prioritize fundamental information needs first
4. Create specific, targeted queries for the most important information
5. Ensure coverage across all subsections, but prioritize depth over breadth
6. Include technical terminology and domain-specific language when appropriate

### For Subsequent Runs (with reflection_feedback):
1. Carefully analyze the reflection feedback to understand information gaps
2. Prioritize queries that address the specific missing information
3. Avoid generating queries too similar to previous_queries
4. Create more specialized or alternative phrasings to find the missing information
5. Use more technical or specific terminology if general queries were insufficient

## Query Construction Guidelines:

1. **Specificity**: Create targeted queries that are likely to return relevant results
   - Include specific technical terms rather than general descriptions
   - Incorporate domain knowledge and specialized terminology

2. **Diversity**: Ensure variety in your query approaches
   - Vary query structure (questions, keyword sets, specific facts to verify)
   - Target different aspects of the subsections
   - Include different perspectives or viewpoints when relevant

3. **Prioritization**: Order queries by importance
   - Place queries for fundamental or critical information first
   - Prioritize queries addressing explicit reflection feedback
   - Ensure the most important subsections are covered in the limited query count

4. **Effectiveness**: Optimize for search engine performance
   - Use search operators when helpful (quotes for exact phrases, etc.)
   - Keep queries concise but descriptive (typically 4-10 words)
   - Include year/recency indicators for time-sensitive topics

Remember: The most important queries should come first in your list, as the system may only use a subset of your generated queries based on the user's `max_queries` setting.
